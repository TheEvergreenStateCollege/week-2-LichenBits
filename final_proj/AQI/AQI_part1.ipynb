This dataset contains geographical and time-series data on various factors that contribute to AQI from all government sites. The main goal at the end for you will be to understand how AQI varies both geographically and over time, and use your analysis (as well as other data that you can find) to be predict AQI at a certain point in time for various locations in California.\n",

The metric AADT, annual average daily traffic, is calculated as the sum of the traffic north of the route (ahead AADT) and south of the route (back AADT).
